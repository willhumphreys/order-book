# Order book

SpringBoot backend and a React frontend.

Java 8 and Node are both required to build and run the application.

* To build the application `mvn install`

* To run the jar file `java -jar target/order-book-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

# To view the application

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

 To run the front end independently navigate to the `frontend` directory and type `npm start`.
 
 To run the backend I recommend opening the project in Intellij and executing the `OrderBookApplication` from there.
